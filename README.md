## üåç Environment Variables

### **Required for Production Deployment**

The app requires environment variables to function correctly in production, particularly for Steam authentication.

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Create environment file**
   ```bash
   # For local development, copy from example
   cp env.example .env.local
   
   # Or create manually
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000" > .env.local
   ```

2. **For Production Deployment**
   
   Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your actual deployed domain:

   **Vercel:**
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

   **Netlify:**
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables  
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

   **Other Platforms:**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your deployed URL
   - Example: `https://steamplaytogether.com`

### **Why This Is Required**

- **Steam Authentication**: Steam OAuth requires a valid return URL
- **Security**: Ensures Steam can validate and redirect to your domain
- **CORS**: Prevents cross-origin issues in production

### **Environment Variables Reference**

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Your app's deployed URL | Yes (Production) | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | No | Auto-set by hosting platforms |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in production, Steam login will fail because it tries to redirect to `localhost:3000`.

## üîß API Endpoints

The app includes several proxy endpoints for Steam API access:

- `POST /api/steam/validate` - Validate API key
- `POST /api/steam/owned-games` - Get user's game library
- `POST /api/steam/friends-list` - Get Steam friends
- `POST /api/steam/player-summaries` - Get player profiles
- `POST /api/steam/common-games` - Find common games
- `POST /api/steam/resolve-vanity` - Convert username to Steam ID

## üéØ Use Cases

### **Gaming Groups**
- Quickly find what your Discord server can play together
- Discover forgotten games in your collections
- Plan gaming sessions with friends

### **Steam Power Users**

### **Friend Discovery**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate Limiting

Steam API has rate limits (200 calls per 5 minutes). The app handles this gracefully:

- **Smart Caching**: Reduces API calls significantly
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages when limits are hit
- **User Guidance**: Tells you exactly how long to wait
- **Fail-Fast**: Stops processing when rate limited
